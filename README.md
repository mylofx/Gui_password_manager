# Gui_password_manager
"A simple gui password manager written in python and pyqt5."

This is a simple gui password manager i write to learn how to use Pqt5.
Now it's not completed. Things that works are only:
*pimitive gui;
*adding paswords to sqlite3 db;
*showing saved passwords;
*editing existing passwords;
*searching passwords

I am planning to add more features like generating passwords etc.
