# Gui_password_manager
"A simple gui password manager written in python and pyqt5."

This is a simple gui password manager i write to learn how to use Pqt5.
Now it's not completed. Things that works are only:
*pimitive gui
*adding paswords to sqlite3 db
I just started writing so it's uncomplite and it lacks basic functionality like showing saved passwords.
I am planning to add this an more feature like genrating passwords etc.
